Since 2022, Rwose has produced music inspired by synthesizers, natural sounds and cyberpunk culture from many of the most popular films in the genre such as Akira, The Running Man, Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner. Rwose uses a variety of sounds in their production from natural sounds recorded in nature to many different types of software and hardware synths like ARP Odyssey, SH-101, Moog.\nRwose production style is reminiscent of the electro pop sounds of the 80’s. Rwose takes inspiration from his childhood memories and synthesizes music that draws the listeners into a world of unique sounds, enchanting melodies, throbbing baselines, open and close hi hat hits. Rwose started making music on a mobile phone whenever inspiration comes, Rwose starts composing. Known for his sonic versatility, the music explores a vast array of emotions such as happiness, escapism, romance, and melancholia, and is often inspired by personal experiences.\nRwose has always been inspired by synth music from classics such as the amazing Italian composer Giorgio Moroder with his awesome synth pop music. Giorgio Moroder is by far Rwose favorite composer, other favorites include The Weeknd, Perturbator, MegaDrive, Carpenter Brut and Kavinsky many more like Japanese pop star Utada Hikaru, Skrillex.\nRwose maintains that their anonymity is a deliberate artistic choice, this allows the most important aspect; their music to shine. The identity of the musician is irrelevant when the music is amazing.\nRwose became interested in music partly during schooling where music was a required elective. The teachers saw potential and encouraged Rwose to keep on working towards music, which led up to the first public single released.\nReleasing the first debut single Sunflower - Rwose; in December 2022 entered the scene as a new artist. With unique sounds, a catchy melody and an entrancing base line, Rwose’s first single entered with a bang.\n","date":"5 December 2022","permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to Rwose Music","summary":"Rwose has a background in piano and the arts.
