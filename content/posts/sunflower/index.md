[Rwose](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2G1K0tD4MWGtHrs9a8xwoi) releasing the debut single [Sunflower](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_me1PRYdCG_UVLQ0DDn6Jpp-FGKGO3lj_s). This track is a demo release. The themes of this song were to create an upbeat melody with a kick drum that keeps pulsating throughout the track. This single wanted to create an upbeat atmosphere riding on the throbbing exciited heart.

The single was inspired by seeing excited kids playing outside after a long drawn out covid isolation. The artist Rwose just like everyone else faced many obstacles throughout the lockdown and isolation, lacking inspiration and motivation but this all changed after a chance encounter after the lockdown was over.

Rwose said this Single has many parts that can be explored further to create a more compelling work but this single was just a burst of inspiration that they could not have kept bottled up.

First Single released to the public, Stay tuned for much more from this brand new Artist; Rwose.
